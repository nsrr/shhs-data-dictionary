  "description": "Intraclass correlation between right and left Odds Ratio Product (ORP) across all epochs in Total Recording Time (TRT). A high correlation indicates good agreement in sleep depth between right and left hemispheres. The reasons for a low correlation could be: <br>  a)  reduced range of ORP across TRT (e.g., little stage wake or deep sleep) <br>  b) systematic difference between the two electrodes (e.g. noise in one electrode or unilateral brain pathology) <br>  c) true dissociation between right and left sleep (Dolphin sleep). <br><br>:icc_ms_rows:, :icc_ms_col: and :icc_ms_error: distinguish between these three possibilities, respectively. <br><br>[Younes et al. 2021 (PubMed ID: 34156473)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34156473/) <br>[Dres et al. 2019 (PubMed ID: 30818966)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30818966/)<br>[Azarbarzin et al. 2021 (PubMed ID: 32441843)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32441843/)  <br><br>[Search for all EEG variables within this dataset](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs/variables?search=eeg_shhs) ",
